This assignment was given with the task of converting wearbale computing data from http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones 
into a tidy data table format to demonstrate our ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set.

Objectives: create a script run_analysis.R which 
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.


The dataset includes the following files:
=========================================

- 'README.txt'

- 'Run_analysis.R: Code which took input of wearable computing data and cleans it into a tidy data output 

- 'tidydf.txt': Generated tidy data set output from run_analysis.R
